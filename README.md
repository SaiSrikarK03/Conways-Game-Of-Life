# Conways-Game-Of-Life
This Python script simulates Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. It features a dynamic grid that adjusts to window resizing, allows users to paint cells alive or dead, and toggles the simulation with the spacebar. A simple UI displays the game's paused or running state, with a toggle option for visibility.
